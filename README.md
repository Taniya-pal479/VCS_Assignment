## 1. Types of Version Control Systems
   The two most popular types of version or revision control systems are centralized and distributed. Centralized version control systems store all the files in a central repository, while distributed version control systems store files across multiple repositories. Other less common types include lock-based and optimistic.

### 1.1 Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**
- All users work with a single central repository.
- The repository can be located on a server or a developer's local machine.
- Typically used in software development teams for code sharing and tracking changes.
- Example: **Subversion (SVN), Perforce.**

### 1.2 Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**
- Every user has a copy of the entire repository.
- Allows offline work and supports collaboration from multiple locations.
- Commonly used in open-source projects and large teams.
- Example: **Git, Mercurial.**

### 1.3 Lock-based Version Control System**
- Uses file locking to manage concurrent access.
- Prevents multiple users from modifying the same file at the same time.
- Example: **Visual SourceSafe (VSS).**

### 1.4 Optimistic Version Control System**
- Allows multiple users to work independently in private workspaces.
- Changes are merged when users submit updates to the server.
- Helps prevent unnecessary conflicts while maintaining flexibility.

## 2. Difference Between Git and GitHub

- Git is a distributed version control system for managing code changes.
+ GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories with collaboration features.

# Type
- Git is a command-line tool for version control.
+ GitHub is an online service that hosts Git repositories.

# Installation
- Git must be installed on a local machine.
+ GitHub is accessed via a web browser (no installation needed).

# Functionality
- Git tracks code changes, branches, and merges locally.
+ GitHub stores repositories remotely and offers CI/CD features.

# Internet Requirement
- Git can work offline; changes are committed locally.
+ GitHub requires internet access for remote collaboration.

# Collaboration
- Git allows version tracking but has no built-in team collaboration.
+ GitHub enables collaboration with pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.

# Security & Access Control
- Git repositories can be private or public but need external access control.
+ GitHub provides private repositories, access control, and authentication.

# Graphical Interface
- Git is mostly command-line based (with optional GUI tools).
+ GitHub provides a web-based UI and GitHub Desktop.

# CI/CD Integration
- Git alone does not support CI/CD.
+ GitHub integrates with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Travis CI for automation.

# Usage
- Git is used by developers to track changes in source code locally.
+ GitHub is used by companies and developers to host and collaborate on projects remotely.

## 3. History of GitHub

GitHub was launched in **April 2008** by **Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, Scott Chacon, and P. J. Hyett**. It started as a platform to host Git repositories and quickly became the largest open-source collaboration tool.

### **Key Milestones**
- **2008**: GitHub was launched.
- **2010**: GitHub surpassed 1 million repositories.
- **2018**: Microsoft acquired GitHub for **$7.5 billion**.
- **Present**: GitHub is the largest code hosting platform, supporting millions of developers worldwide.

GitHub has played a significant role in the open-source community by providing features like **pull requests, issues, GitHub Actions, and Codespaces** for better collaboration and automation.
